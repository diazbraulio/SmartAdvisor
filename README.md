SmartAdvisor
============

This is an app that a group of students and I created in our Software Engineering class at California State University, 
Northridge. The purpose of this was to provide an app that makes a plan to graduation for the user. If the user has to
repeat a class or wasn't able to get into one, then the user can let the app know and it will recalculate a plan to
graduation. Since the university doesn't have a notification system for letting the user know about the deadline for
tuition payments and registration date deadlines, this app provides one.
